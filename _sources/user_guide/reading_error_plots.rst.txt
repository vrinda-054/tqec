Reading logical error-rate plots
================================

The gallery and several user-guide notebooks plot the **logical error rate** of a
computation as a function of the physical error rate and the code distance. This page
explains how to read those plots.

The example below comes from the :doc:`quick_start` guide. The same reading applies to
memory experiments, Steane encoding, and the other gallery notebooks. For background on
thresholds and distance scaling, see :ref:`surface_codes`.

   depolarizing noise.


The axes
--------

The **physical error rate** on the horizontal axis is the noise strength :math:`p`
applied to the compiled ``stim`` circuit. Most examples use
:meth:`~tqec.utils.noise_model.NoiseModel.uniform_depolarizing`, but any noise model
parameterized by a single rate :math:`p` can be plotted the same way.

The **logical error rate** on the vertical axis is the estimated probability that one shot of the
full experiment ends with a wrong decoded outcome for the observable under study. Both
axes use a logarithmic scale.

By default, ``sinter.plot_error_rate`` reports this rate **per shot**. Several gallery
notebooks instead pass ``failure_units_per_shot_func=lambda stat: stat.json_metadata["d"]``,
which rescales the axis to an approximation of the logical error rate **per QEC round** (check the y-axis
label on the plot you are reading). The example at the top of this page is per shot.

Each curve corresponds to one **code distance** :math:`d`. In ``tqec``, distances are
generated from the scaling parameter :math:`k` by :math:`d = 2k + 1`.


The inset
---------

The :doc:`quick_start` guide and gallery notebooks usually include a small ZX graph in
a corner. It shows the computation that was simulated and the logical observable the
curve refers to. Other pages may show static figures instead, or a threshold zoom inset
as in :doc:`detailed_plots`, rather than this ZX diagram.

The graph is the spacetime diagram of the ``BlockGraph``, obtained with
:code:`block_graph.to_zx_graph()`. **Red** nodes are :math:`X`-type spiders and **blue**
nodes are :math:`Z`-type spiders, as elsewhere in ``tqec`` (see
:ref:`Correlation Surface <terminology>`).

The thick highlighted edges trace a :ref:`correlation surface <terminology>`: the
measurements whose parity tracks how a logical operator is transformed from input to
output. The surface shown is the one passed to
:func:`~tqec.simulation.simulation.start_simulation_using_sinter`. If you change the
observable or the computation, both the inset and the curves change.

The inset is drawn by :func:`~tqec.simulation.plotting.inset.plot_observable_as_inset`.


How the points are computed
---------------------------

Each marker is estimated from many independent shots. For each plotted distance
:math:`d`, ``tqec`` uses the corresponding scaling parameter :math:`k` with
:math:`d = 2k + 1`. For each pair :math:`(k, p)`, equivalently :math:`(d, p)`:

1. The ``BlockGraph`` is compiled at that distance and exported to a
   noiseless ``stim`` circuit with detectors and logical observables.
2. Noise at rate :math:`p` is injected through the chosen noise-model factory.
3. ``stim`` simulates the circuit and records detector syndromes and uncorrected
   logical outcomes.
4. A decoder (typically ``pymatching``) predicts the logical correction bit from the
   syndromes.
5. A mismatch between the corrected logical outcome and the expected value counts as
   one logical error.
6. The logical error rate is estimated from the fraction of non-discarded shots with a
   logical error, together with uncertainty bounds (reported per shot or per round
   depending on how the plot is configured).

In code this is handled by
:func:`~tqec.simulation.simulation.start_simulation_using_sinter`, which builds tasks
with :func:`~tqec.simulation.generation.generate_sinter_tasks` and collects statistics
via ``sinter``. Sampling stops when ``max_shots`` and/or ``max_errors`` is reached,
which is one reason some low-noise points may be missing (see
:ref:`Confidence intervals and missing points <error_plot_confidence>`).


Below and above threshold
-------------------------

Scalable QEC code families of practical importance have an **error threshold**
:math:`p_\text{th}`: a physical error rate below which increasing the distance
suppresses the logical error rate, and above which increasing the distance no longer
improves the result. The surface-code scaling law is discussed on the
:ref:`surface_codes` page.

On a typical plot, three regimes are visible:

**Below threshold** — at low :math:`p`, curves for larger :math:`d` lie lower. On a
log–log plot they often look like straight lines.

**Above threshold** — at high :math:`p`, all curves converge toward a logical error
rate near :math:`1/2`. Increasing :math:`d` no longer helps.

**Near the crossing** — where curves for different distances meet gives a rough visual
estimate of :math:`p_\text{th}` for that computation, decoder, and noise model. In the
CNOT plot above, the inset zooms into this crossing region and the red vertical line
marks the estimated threshold. For a more precise value, use
:func:`~tqec.simulation.threshold.binary_search_threshold` as in :doc:`detailed_plots`.

The numeric ranges mentioned above depend on the example. The CNOT plot at the top of
this page crosses near :math:`p \sim 5 \times 10^{-3}`; your computation may differ.


The slope below threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below threshold, the most useful feature is the **slope of each curve on the log–log
plot**. A steeper slope means that increasing :math:`d` suppresses logical errors faster
as :math:`p` is reduced.

Near threshold, a common rule of thumb (see :ref:`surface_codes`) is

.. math::

   p_L \;\propto\; \left(\frac{p}{p_\text{th}}\right)^{\lfloor (d+1)/2 \rfloor}

When comparing two implementations, check both the vertical separation at fixed
:math:`p` and whether the slopes match. A constant vertical shift with the same slope
suggests overhead; different slopes suggest a change in effective distance or a bug in
the implementation.


Error suppression factor :math:`\Lambda`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **error suppression factor** :math:`\Lambda` measures how much the logical error
rate drops when the distance increases. One practical estimate at fixed :math:`p`
below threshold is

.. math::

   \Lambda \;\approx\; \frac{p_L(d)}{p_L(d')}

for :math:`d' = d+2` at the same :math:`p` below threshold
(so :math:`\Lambda > 1` when suppression improves with distance). Values close to what
the power-law scaling above predicts
indicate healthy surface-code-like behaviour. A much smaller :math:`\Lambda` suggests
extra failure mechanisms — boundary effects, hook errors, or decoder limitations — that
reduce the expected suppression.

This matters for resource estimation: knowing how fast :math:`p_L` falls with :math:`d`
tells you how large a code is needed at a given hardware error rate.


Pseudo-threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a fixed distance, the **pseudo-threshold** is the physical error rate where
the logical error rate crosses the unencoded baseline. When that baseline is the same
quantity as the physical error rate on the x-axis, this appears as the diagonal guide
line :math:`p_L = p` on a log-log plot. Below that crossing, the finite-distance
encoded computation is suppressing errors relative to the baseline; above it, it is
not.

Like :math:`p_\text{th}`, a pseudo-threshold depends on the circuit, decoder, and
noise model. Unlike :math:`p_\text{th}`, it also depends on the chosen distance and on
whether the plot reports failures per shot or per round. Treat it as a quick visual
guide only, especially when the y-axis has been rescaled per round. To argue that a
computation is below threshold, compare curves across several distances or run a
dedicated threshold search.


.. _error_plot_confidence:

Confidence intervals and missing points
---------------------------------------

The shaded bands are **confidence regions** for the binomial parameter being plotted on
the y-axis (per shot or per round). They are not symmetric Gaussian error bars.

``sinter.plot_error_rate`` uses :code:`sinter.fit_binomial`, which includes all rates
whose likelihood is within a factor :code:`max_likelihood_factor` of the
maximum-likelihood estimate. Because the logical error rate lies in :math:`[0, 1]`, the
intervals are naturally asymmetric, especially near the boundaries of that interval. For
more detail, see this discussion of
`binomial confidence intervals <https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/a/37268>`_.

**Wide bands at low** :math:`p` usually mean that few logical errors were observed
before sampling stopped. Estimating a rate of :math:`10^{-6}` with tight bounds requires
either a very large number of shots or stopping only after many errors; if ``max_shots``
is reached first, little data is collected on the left side of the plot.

**Missing markers** on the low-noise side of a plot typically mean that no logical
errors were recorded (:code:`errors == 0`), so ``sinter.plot_error_rate`` omits the
point, or that the corresponding simulation task did not finish. Increasing
``max_shots``, ``max_errors``, or reusing a ``save_resume_filepath`` fills in the left
side of the plot at the cost of longer runs.

You might occasionally see **duplicate markers** at the same :math:`p`; this is a known
plotting artifact tracked in `issue #825 <https://github.com/tqec/tqec/issues/825>`_.
